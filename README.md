# basys3-reaction-game
SDSU Final Lab Project using Basys3 board.

The purpose of this lab was to create a reaction time game. The work flow for this project begins when the user presses the left button to begin the game. Then in a random time up to 10 seconds an LED will light up. Once the led lights up, the counter begins to count up on the seven segment display. The user then wants to press the right button to stop the clock and pause the counter of the seven segment display. The user can then press the center button to reset the game and wait for the LED to light up again. The purpose of the game is to press the STOP right button as soon as the LED comes ON. The lowest number in the counter represents the amount of points, in which you want the least amount of points.
